#	子查询进阶
##	1.查询
*	非相关子查询当作一张表来用:


    SELECT a.last_name, a.salary, a.department_id, b.salavg
    FROM employees a, (SELECT department_id,
        AVG(salary) salavg
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id) b
    WHERE a.department_id = b.department_id
    AND a.salary > b.salavg;


*	相关子查询的概念: **子查询中参考了外部主查询中的表。**


    SELECT last_name, salary, department_id
    FROM employees outer
    WHERE salary > (
    	SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM employees
        WHERE department_id = outer.department_id);

- - -

    SELECT e.employee_id, last_name,e.job_id
    FROM employees e
    WHERE 2 <= (SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM job_history
    WHERE employee_id = e.employee_id);

使用`Exists`操作:

	SELECT employee_id, last_name, job_id, department_id
    FROM employees outer
    WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 'X'
        FROM employees
        WHERE manager_id =
        outer.employee_id);

- - -

    SELECT employee_id,last_name,job_id,department_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL);

`Exists`和`IN`的区别：

*	当`Exists`的子句不满足条件时，不会查询子表
*	`IN`会先查询子表

使用`Not Exists`操作:

    SELECT department_id, department_name
    FROM departments d
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'X'
        FROM employees
        WHERE department_id
        = d.department_id);

- - -

    SELECT department_id, department_name
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT department_id
    	FROM employees);

**`Not Exists`和 `NOT IN`的区别*与上面的相同
*注意：*`Not In`里面只要有一个NULL ，就不成立了，这是很容易出错的地方； 正确的方法请在后面的子查询中加上`where department_id is not null`

##	2.UPDATE
在`Update`语句中使用相关子查询：

    UPDATE employees e
    SET department_name =
        (SELECT department_name
        FROM departments d
        WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id);

##	3.DELETE
在`DELETE`语句中使用相关子查询

    DELETE FROM job_history JH
    WHERE employee_id = (
    	SELECT employee_id
        FROM employees E
        WHERE JH.employee_id = E.employee_id
        AND start_date =
        	(SELECT MIN(start_date)
        	FROM job_history JH
        	WHERE JH.employee_id = E.employee_id)
        	AND 5 > (SELECT COUNT(*)
        		FROM job_history JH
                WHERE JH.employee_id = E.employee_id
                GROUP BY employee_id
                HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4));

##	4.WITH
使用`WITH`子句

    WITH
    dept_costs AS (
    SELECT d.department_name, SUM(e.salary) AS dept_total
    FROM employees e, departments d
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    GROUP BY d.department_name),
    avg_cost AS (
    SELECT SUM(dept_total)/COUNT(*) AS dept_avg
    FROM dept_costs)
    SELECT *
    FROM dept_costs
    WHERE dept_total >
        (SELECT dept_avg
        FROM avg_cost)
    ORDER BY department_name;

使用`WITH`的好处：

*	如果在后面多次使用则可以简化SQL
*	适当提高性能
